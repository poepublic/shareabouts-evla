<h1>{{#_}}About This Map{{/_}}</h1>

<p>{{#_}}This website marks the beginning of a public outreach process to help the City of Philadelphia plan for bike share. The City needs your help to identify 60 station locations for program launch next spring. The map shows almost 100 potential station locations. Please comment on these possible locations and share other feedback by October 20, 2014.{{/_}}</p>
