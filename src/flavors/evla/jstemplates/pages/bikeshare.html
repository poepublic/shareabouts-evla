<h1>{{#_}}About Bike Share{{/_}}</h1>

<p>{{#_}}Bike share is public transportation on your schedule. In spring 2015, Philadelphia will join Chicago, Washington DC, Boston, New York City, and more than 30 other cities across North America in offering this new form of affordable, convenient transportation.{{/_}}</p>

<p>{{#_}}With bike share, members and walk-up users will be able to check out bikes from one of 60 stations, take a 30-minute trip for work, school, errands, or fun, and then return the bike to any other station in the system. Pricing is still in development. Bikes will feature easily adjustable seats, front and rear LED lights, baskets, and bells.{{/_}}</p>

<p>{{#_}}All bicycles and stations will be owned by the City of Philadelphia and will be cleaned and maintained by the company <a href="http://bicycletransitsystems.com/" target="_blank">Bicycle Transit Systems</a>, the City's chosen bike share operator.

<p>{{#_}}The City of Philadelphia will launch with 60 stations in spring 2015, and intends to expand the system with an additional 60 stations in spring 2016.
